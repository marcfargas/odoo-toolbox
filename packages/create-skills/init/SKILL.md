# /odoo

Odoo ERP integration with progressive module loading. Connect, introspect, and automate.

## Prerequisites (Must Read First)

Before any Odoo operation, load these foundational modules:

1. `base/connection.md` - Authentication & session management
2. `base/field-types.md` - Odoo type system (read/write asymmetry)
3. `base/domains.md` - Query filter syntax

## Additional Modules

Load as needed by reading `base/{name}.md`:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| introspection | Discover models & fields |
| crud | Create, read, update, delete patterns |
| search | Search & filtering patterns |
| properties | Dynamic user-defined fields |
| modules | Module lifecycle management |
| skill-generation | How to create new skills |

## Module-Specific Skills

Skills that require specific Odoo modules to be installed. Before loading, verify the required modules are present using `base/modules.md` introspection.

Load by reading `modules/{name}.md`:

| Skill | Required Modules | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| mis-builder | `mis_builder`, `date_range`, `report_xlsx` | MIS Builder financial reports (PnL, Balance Sheet) |

## Instance Skills

Custom skills for this Odoo instance in `skills/`:

<!-- Agent: Update this section when creating new skills -->
<!-- Example:
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| create-lead | Create CRM leads |
| update-partner | Update partner records |
-->
