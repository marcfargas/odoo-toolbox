/**
 * Markdown Documentation Examples Integration Tests
 *
 * This file automatically extracts and tests code examples from
 * the meta-skills documentation markdown files.
 *
 * Code blocks marked with `testable` in their fence metadata are
 * extracted and executed against a real Odoo instance.
 *
 * Example annotation:
 * ```typescript testable id="basic-connection" needs="client" expect="session !== null"
 * const session = client.getSession();
 * ```
