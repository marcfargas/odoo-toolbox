/**
 * Example 3: Search and Filtering
 *
 * Demonstrates how to:
 * - Search with Odoo domain filters
 * - Use comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, in, etc.)
 * - Combine conditions with AND/OR logic
 * - Paginate results (limit, offset)
 * - Order by fields
 * - Use searchRead for combined search + read in one call
 * - Filter by model fields and relationships
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Odoo instance running and authenticated
 * - Some sample data in res.partner
 *
 * Run: npx ts-node packages/odoo-client/examples/3-search-and-filter.ts
