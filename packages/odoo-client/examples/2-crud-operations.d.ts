/**
 * Example 2: CRUD Operations
 *
 * Demonstrates how to:
 * - Create records (POST/create)
 * - Read records (GET/read)
 * - Update records (PUT/write)
 * - Delete records (DELETE/unlink)
 * - Handle responses and errors
 * - Use context for special behavior
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Odoo instance running and authenticated
 * - Write access to res.partner model
 *
 * Run: npx ts-node packages/odoo-client/examples/2-crud-operations.ts
 *
 * Note: This example creates and deletes test records. It's safe to run
 * but does modify your Odoo database.
