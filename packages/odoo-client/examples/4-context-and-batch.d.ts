/**
 * Example 4: Context Variables and Batch Operations
 *
 * Demonstrates how to:
 * - Use Odoo context variables to control behavior
 * - Disable field tracking/audit trail
 * - Set default field values
 * - Control timezone and language settings
 * - Perform efficient batch operations
 * - Understand when to use context
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Odoo instance running and authenticated
 * - Write access to res.partner model
 *
 * Run: npx ts-node packages/odoo-client/examples/4-context-and-batch.ts
 *
 * Important: Context is a powerful feature in Odoo that allows you to:
 * - Pass metadata about the operation
 * - Control model-specific behavior
 * - Set defaults for fields
 * - Disable audit/tracking
 * - Handle multi-company scenarios
 *
 * See AGENTS.md for common context variables and where they're handled.
